<h1>Hamachi Setup</h1>

<p>Hi! If you're reading then you have, intentionally or otherwise, signed up to be a beta tester for my shit! Thanks! You're super cool.</p>
<p>In order for you to get access to builds and the bug tracker you'll need to connect to my computer. Since I can't host a server right now and I don't own a virtual private server you'll have to connect directly via VPN. That's what this guide is going to help you with.</p>
<p>To connect to my computer we'll be using Hamachi, which provides VPN services. In order to do use Hamachi, follow these steps.</p>

<h2>Step 1. Download Hamachi</h2>

<p>Simply go to the Hamachi download site (<a href="https://secure.logmein.com/products/hamachi/download.aspx">link</a>!). Agree to the CONDITIONS OF USE at the bottom, then click the DOWNLOAD NOW button under the UNMANAGED heading.</p>

<h2>Step 2. Install Hamachi</h2>

<p>Open the installer (hamachi.msi). You can just accept all the defaults.</p>

<h2>Step 3. Launch Hamachi and Configure</h2>

<p>Launch Hamachi (there's probably an icon on your desktop). Click the big power button like it tells you to. It will then present you with a YOU MUST SIGN UP screen.</p>
<p>Look for the link at the bottom that says SEND THEM AN ATTACH REQUEST (it should be blue) and click that. Enter my email then click ATTACH.</p>
<p>Now you'll have to wait for me to get off my ass and accept the request. If you tell me it'll speed up the process.</p>

<h2>Step 4. Connect to my computer</h2>

<p>Once I accept you'll be presented with a JOIN AN EXISTING NETWORK button; click it! Enter in the server and password I provided then click JOIN.</p>
<p>If successful you'll get something like this:</p>

<p>The four numbers next to MIKE-DESK-WIN7 is my IP (in the image it's 25.21.186.94). Enter that number into your browser, followed by :8080 (so 25.21.186.94:8080) then hit enter. That should connect you to my bugtracker!</p>
<p>The front page will have more info (e.g. how to download, how to create tickets, etc.).</p>

<h2>Have fun and report lots of bugs!</h2>
