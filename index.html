    <!--
    The structure of the code for the layout of the games section is different
    from the rest in that each entry is a new table. This helps support the
    layout I wanted with the image alternating from far left to far right each
    alternate entry. I found that using a div with image floating didn't make
    the layout very robust: if the text and image heights were off then the
    layout broke. Although I despise tables with a passion I prefer a
    functioning layout.

    Text is contained in a <td class="text"> tag so I can differentiate between
    cells with image and cells with text; that way each can get their own
    styling.

    This is a <table> so image positioning is pretty easy. To make the image
    appear on the left place the <td><img></td> BEFORE the descriptive text. To
    make the image appear on the right place the <td><img></td> AFTER the text.

    <h3> was used for entry headers (along with custom styling) because the
    text is the right size and comes bolded. I suppose I could just use a div
    with 125% font size and bold font weight.

			<p>Made in a month for CS 488 at UWaterloo. Due to the nature of the project, I had to put more focus on the graphics (e.g. normal mapping, particle systems, etc). However, I managed to pull together something playable.</p>
